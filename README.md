## 🎸 A Glimpse into My Life

When I’m not crafting elegant code or sketching UI concepts, you’ll probably find me:
- 🎤 **Singing my heart out** while strumming my guitar like I’m on tour.
- 🎬 Watching **comedy sitcoms and movies** that make me laugh out loud.
- 🎧 **Discovering new music** to keep the vibe alive.
- 🌍 Exploring **new ideas, hobbies, and experiences** because life is too short to stay in one lane.
